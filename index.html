        <section id="about-me">
            <p>Hello! I’m Jack Phillips - Marino, a passionate technology enthusiast with a strong focus on computer science, cloud systems, and AI. Currently a senior in high school, I have been actively pursuing my interest in these fields through various projects and internships. My journey into the world of technology began with a deep curiosity about how things work, which has since evolved into a commitment to developing innovative solutions that can make a difference.

                I've worked on several exciting projects, including creating an AI-powered chatbot for industry brainstorming and developing a process to recycle plastic bottles into 3D printer filament. My dedication to sustainability is reflected in my involvement with the Green Team, where I’ve led projects to improve energy efficiency at my school. I’ve also built a vertical wind turbine and a water wheel, showcasing my interest in merging engineering with environmental consciousness.
                
                In addition to my technical pursuits, I enjoy staying active through soccer and skiing, and I have a deep love for gardening—both indoors and outdoors. I’m always eager to learn and take on new challenges, and I’m looking forward to continuing my journey in the tech world, with the ultimate goal of making impactful contributions in cloud systems engineering.
                
                Thanks for visiting my site, and I hope you find my projects as exciting as I do!</p>

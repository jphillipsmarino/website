        <h1>Recycling Plastic Bottles to 3D Printer Filament</h1>
        <p>This project focuses on tackling plastic waste by converting discarded plastic bottles into usable 3D printer filament. The process involves collecting, cleaning, and shredding plastic bottles, followed by melting and extruding the plastic into filament suitable for 3D printing.</p>
        <p>More detailed information about this project will be added here, including technical details, challenges faced, and the impact of the project.</p>
